    <h1>Time and Space Complexity in Algorithm Analysis</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as the input size grows. Understanding Time complexity helps developers create more efficient algorithms by analyzing how the execution time increases with larger inputs. It's essential for optimizing code performance and selecting the most suitable algorithm for a given problem.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It's often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates linear space usage. Space Complexity is important when dealing with large datasets or memory-constrained environments, as it helps balance memory usage with computational efficiency.</p>
